# Overview

## 1. Introduction
- **Face Attributes Recognition** application of machine learning aimed at automatically extracting essential **demographic information** from human faces which can for **analyzing market**, and **leading marketing decisions**.
- The primary objectives of this project are to develop a robust model capable of accurately identifying the **age**, **gender**, and **ethnicity** of individuals from facial images.
- This documentation provides an in-depth overview of the methodology, data preprocessing, model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics employed in achieving these objectives.

## 2. Problem Statement
- Despite advancements in computer vision, accurately inferring demographic attributes from facial images remains challenging due to variations in facial expressions, lighting conditions, and image quality.
- The project aims to address these challenges by leveraging machine learning techniques to build a reliable and efficient face's attributes recognition system.

## 3. Data
- The [UTK Face dataset](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/) serves as the primary data source for this project, providing over **20,000** face images annotated with **age**, **gender**, and **ethnicity** attributes.
- This dataset covers a broad age range from **0 to 116 years old** and exhibits diverse variations in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc.
- After preprocessing steps, such as **removing grayscale images** and those with **missing labels**, the UTK Face dataset was deemed suitable for training and evaluating the face's attributes recognition model.

## 4. Model Architecture
- The model architecture is designed to extract high-level features from facial images using **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** while incorporating techniques like **transfer learning** to improve performance.
- Specialized modules are incorporated to handle **multitask learning**, allowing the model to simultaneously predict age, gender, and ethnicity attributes.

## 5. Training Process
- The training process involves optimizing the model parameters using suitable loss functions and optimization algorithms.
- Techniques such as **hyperparameter tuning** are employed to maximize model performance while **preventing overfitting** and improving **generalization**.

## 6. Evaluation Metrics
- The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics tailored to each attribute, including **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **R<sup>2</sup>**.
- Comprehensive testing is conducted on both validation and unseen test datasets to assess the model's robustness and reliability in **real-world** scenarios.
